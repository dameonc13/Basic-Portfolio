                <p> I enjoy a good sunny day in the cold winter time that is dry and humid but is also freezing drinking
                    a large in a small cup tea of chilled ice.
                    Staring in the clouds my pillows so fresh so clean. Chilling with my pet fly he so greedy always
                    tasting my food.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He disappear every winter and reappear every spring like a true father he is. The blues of the
                    waters flows under my feet as i walk with my head down in the ground.
                </p>
                <p>As the two earths collide the sun glares blinds the window the heat from his mouth burns into his
                    coffee. If They could walk where would they sing if
                    they could listen where would the walk if they didn't bark would they be loved. Don't let the greens
                    fool you for the deception of man is bewildering.
                </p>
